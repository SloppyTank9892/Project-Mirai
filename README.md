# Project-Mirai

---

## **Project Proposal — Mirai**

**Tagline:** *Your Future, Guided by Experience*

### **1. Problem Statement**

University students often struggle to make informed career and skill-development decisions because:

* Guidance is scattered across multiple platforms and informal chats.
* There's no central place to connect with experienced seniors or alumni.
* Career questions often get lost in generic discussion forums or social groups.
* Students lack structured access to real placement statistics, skill-building resources, and mentorship.

### **2. Solution — Mirai**

**Mirai** is a **career-focused peer-to-peer mentorship and AI guidance platform** for students, powered by Bubble for rapid prototyping and AI for intelligent support.

**Core MVP Features:**

1. **AI Career Guide** – GPT-powered chatbot that gives tailored advice on career paths, skills to learn, and interview preparation.
2. **Mentor Connect** – 1:1 mentorship booking with seniors and alumni based on skill/industry filters.
3. **Passion & Skill Matching** – Students select passion tags (e.g., data science, design, entrepreneurship) and get matched to relevant mentors, peers, and resources.
4. **Placement Insights** – Centralized, verified stats about past recruiters, roles, and packages for informed career planning.
5. **Karma System** – Earn points for helping others, sharing resources, and hosting sessions (gamifies contribution).

### **3. Why Mirai Stands Out**

* **Focused on Careers** → No noise from hostel, mess, or event chatter — 100% growth and passion-oriented.
* **AI-Powered Matching** → Not just a directory — smart recommendations for mentors, courses, and peers.
* **University-Aligned but Expandable** → Can start at MUJ and later scale to other campuses.
* **Gamified Engagement** → Keeps students active with recognition for helping others.

### **4. Target Users**

* **Students** (looking for skill guidance, internships, projects)
* **Seniors & Alumni** (willing to mentor, share experiences)
* **Placement Cells & Clubs** (can share verified stats and opportunities)

---

### **5. Tech Stack (for MVP)**

* **Frontend & Backend**: Bubble (No-code)
* **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT API for chatbot & recommendations
* **Database**: Bubble’s built-in DB
* **Scheduling**: Bubble plugin for calendar booking
* **Authentication**: Email or university ID login

---

### **6. Development Timeline** (Deadline: 24 Aug 2025)

**Week 1 (Aug 8–14):**

* Finalize UI/UX wireframe in Bubble
* Build user login & profile creation (passion tags, skills)
* Integrate mentor directory page

**Week 2 (Aug 15–20):**

* Add AI chatbot with OpenAI API
* Create booking system for 1:1 mentor calls
* Add placement statistics page

**Week 3 (Aug 21–23):**

* Add karma points system
* Test end-to-end workflows
* Prepare pitch deck & demo video

**Aug 24:** Final submission

---

### **7. Team Roles** (4 Members)

* **Project Lead / Bubble Dev** – Oversees entire build, designs pages, integrates core features.
* **AI & API Integrator** – Sets up OpenAI chatbot, testing prompts, connects mentor matching logic.
* **Data & Content Manager** – Collects placement data, mentor info, creates course/resource content.
* **UI/UX Designer & Tester** – Designs visual theme, ensures smooth navigation, conducts user testing.

---

### **8. Long-Term Vision**

After the hackathon, Mirai can evolve into a multi-university platform with:

* Verified industry mentors from outside the university.
* Paid premium mentorship tiers.
* Integration with LinkedIn for profile building.
* AI-driven personalized learning paths.

Next, I can prepare a **pitch slide outline** for you so you can plug this directly into a PPT and impress your team & judges. That way, you’ll have both the **document proposal** and a **presentation version** ready.
